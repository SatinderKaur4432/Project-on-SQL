# Project-on-SQL
This SQL-based project is built around a simulated or real-world relational database for a company involved in the import and export of specialty food products across international markets. The primary goal of the project is to extract actionable business insights from transactional and operational data using advanced SQL queries.

The project utilizes structured data stored in multiple interrelated tables representing various business domains such as sales, customers, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping logistics, employees, and accounting. The comprehensive scope of the dataset enables the analysis of both front-end sales performance and back-end operations.

# Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To analyze sales trends across various countries and products.
To identify top-performing customers and regions.
To evaluate inventory turnover and stock replenishment cycles.
To monitor supplier performance and purchasing efficiency.
To track shipping performance and identify bottlenecks in logistics.
To support basic financial analysis using accounting records.
To explore employee performance metrics, such as sales volume and fulfillment rate.

# SQL Techniques Used

To derive meaningful insights, a wide array of SQL tools and techniques are employed:

JOIN Operations: Used extensively to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., joining Orders, Customers, and Employees to analyze sales by representative and region).
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Implemented for organizing complex queries and improving readability, especially in multi-step analyses.
Aggregation Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN): Utilized for summarizing data such as total sales, average order size, or monthly revenue per region.
Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LEAD(), LAG()): Applied to calculate running totals, rank products/customers, and analyze trends over time.
Subqueries and Nested Queries: Used in cases requiring filtered aggregations or conditional evaluations.
CASE Statements: To perform conditional logic within queries, such as classifying customers based on purchase frequency or categorizing orders by value.
Date Functions: Leveraged to group data by month/quarter/year and measure shipping or delivery times.

# Outcomes and Insights

This SQL project simulates real-world data analytics scenarios and provides stakeholders with data-driven insights for:

Strategic decision-making in procurement and sales.
Operational improvements in shipping and inventory management.
Customer relationship management through segmentation and targeting.
Performance evaluation across different departments.
